# OTP Verification Application

This is an OTP verification application that consists of a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Node.js. The application simulates user authentication using hardcoded OTPs.

The project contains two main folders:

- **frontend**: Contains the React application for user interaction.
- **backend**: Contains the Node.js server that handles OTP verification and session management.

## Features

- Hardcoded OTP for verification (fixed as `1234`).
- Session management with a 1-minute expiration time after login.

## Steps To run

- cd frontend, npm i, npm start
- cd backend, npm in, node server.js
- Use OTP as 1234 and ID as 1 or 2
